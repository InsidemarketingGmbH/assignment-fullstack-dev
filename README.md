# Fullstack Developer Assignment
**Objective: This assignment aims to assess your fullstack development skills. This will simulate a basic library management system. You will build both the backend (PHP with Symfony + DB schema) and frontend (React) functionalities.**

### Functionality:
* Users can view a list of available books. (20 sample data entries should be enough and the data source can be taken from the [OpenLibrary.org](https://openlibrary.org/collections/greatbooks))
* Each book has a title, author and date.
* Users can search for books by title and author.

### Requirements/prerequisites:
* Frontend: React
* Backend: PHP with Symfony framework
* Database: MySQL (or any equivalent)

### Part 1: Database Schema Design (~1 hour)
1. Design a simple database schema for the library management system with table(s) for books and book details.

### Part 2: Backend (PHP with Symfony) (~1.5 hours)
1. Create a minimal Symfony project and define models for Book entities.
2. Implement functionalities to:
    * List all available books
    * Search for books by title or author (using SQL or a query builder)
3. Implement API endpoints for the functionalities mentioned above.

### Part 3: Frontend (React) (~1.5 hour)
1. Develop a component to display a list of books with date, title, and author information.
2. Implement the following functionalities:
   * pagination to show 10 books at one load. And show a "next" button to load 10 more without refreshing the page.
   * a basic search bar to filter books by title and author.
* Bonus point for responsive layout.

### Testing:
* Focus on manual testing (UAT) of the functionalities for the basic app.

### Notes:
* Focus on clean code practices, meaningful variables and functions naming, and basic code commenting - for both the backend and frontend.
* This is a sample assignment, and the focus should be on demonstrating core concepts and building a functional application.
* Feel free to use additional libraries or tools as needed, but document them in your README file.

**Once completed, submit it to your GitHub account, including the SQL export file for the DB schema and sample data and provide us with the repository link. Also include a README file with instructions on how to run your application (setup, dependencies).**

## Have fun!
